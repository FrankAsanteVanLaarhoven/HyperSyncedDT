## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and considerate of others when participating in this project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyper-synced-dt-mvp.git
   cd hyper-synced-dt-mvp
   ```
3. Set up the development environment as described in the README.md
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Add tests for your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages
6. Push your branch to your fork
7. Submit a pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR includes a clear description of the changes and the purpose
2. Link any relevant issues in the PR description
3. Make sure all CI checks pass
4. Request a review from at least one maintainer
5. Address any feedback from reviewers
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
- Keep functions focused and small (under 50 lines when possible)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Frontend (Streamlit)

- Organize UI components logically
- Use consistent styling
- Ensure responsive design
- Comment complex UI logic

### API (FastAPI)

- Use appropriate HTTP methods
- Document endpoints with OpenAPI comments
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate input data

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
- Mock external dependencies when necessary
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Include integration tests for critical paths

## Documentation

- Update README.md with any new features or changes
- Document API endpoints in the code
- Add comments for complex algorithms or logic
- Update requirements.txt when adding new dependencies
